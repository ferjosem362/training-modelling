Following SMDM participation in the Call for Transparency in Covid-19 Models (Science, May 2020), this symposium proposal aims to provide SMDM members with a panel of top researchers leading innovative open science and model transparency initiatives for Covid-19 pandemics. The panel shall illuminate new ways to share models, knowledge and technology to better anticipate, predict, and respond to the Covid-19 pandemics (and beyond).
