# Abstract

**Purpose**: To improve the accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) methods for users and developers of decision-analytic models.

 

**Methods**: We developed the R package [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) (Decision-Analytic Modeling Package) to analyze and visualize CEA results with expanded functionality over similar existing packages. Using standard CEA outputs exported from a model developed in any software, [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) facilitates both basic and advanced calculations of CEA results crucial for informing decision making. Users can input results into [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) in one of two ways: as a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) dataset or as deterministic results (e.g., expected costs and effectiveness of each strategy). The package can be used to identify dominated strategies, calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, plot the efficient frontier, and visualize one- and two-way sensitivity analyses. Additionally, for PSA datasets, [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) users can construct cost-effectiveness acceptability and expected loss curves and compute the expected value of perfect, partial, and sample information. Sensitivity and value of information analysis functionality are implemented using linear meta-models based on the PSA samples. We also designed [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) to deliver customizable, publication-quality figures for all analyses. The source code of the [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) package is freely available, allowing users to easily customize and extend its functionality. To demonstrate the functionality of [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack), we analyzed the PSA outputs from a previously published evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). The PSA compared 48 treatment strategies, sampling 10,000 sets of 51 parameters.

 

**Results**: CEA results generated by [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) from the C. diff PSA are shown in the 4-panel figure. The cost-effectiveness plot highlights the six strategies on the efficient frontier, while also indicating strongly and weakly dominated strategies. One-way sensitivity analysis plots show how the optimal strategy changes as model parameters are varied individually. PSA results are additionally summarized through cost-effectiveness acceptability and expected loss curves. For each, [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) also plots the frontier, indicating the optimal strategy in expectation at each willingness-to-pay threshold.

**Conclusion**: [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) is a powerful and flexible package for the analysis and visualization of CEA results. It can summarize key CEA results, even when comparing a large number of strategies. With user-friendly and computationally efficient implementations, [`dampack`](https://github.com/DARTH-git/dampack) also facilitates the use of state-of-the-art economic evaluation methods, such as value of information analysis, to a broader user-base.
