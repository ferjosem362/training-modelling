In this talk, I presented the health burden of *Helicobacter pylori* (*H. pylori*) and gastric cancer in Mexico. I presented the estimation of the force of infection of *H. pylori* in Mexico using data from a seroprevalence survey conducted in the country in 1988-89 with a [Bayesian hierarchical nonlinear model](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/force-of-infection-of-helicobacter-pylori-in-mexico-evidence-from-a-national-survey-using-a-hierarchical-bayesian-model/0DDBEB522863B7851A617CD9CB13B189). I described the construction and validation of an age-structured transmission model of *H. pylori* accounting for antibiotic resistance, and its expansion to account for gastric disease dynamics. I showed how this model can be used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different screen-and-treat strategies for *H. pylori* to decrease gastric cancer mortality at a population level.
