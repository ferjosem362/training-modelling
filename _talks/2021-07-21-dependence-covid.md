In this paper we used the Stanford-CIDE Coronavirus Simulation Model (SC-COSMO) to evaluate the effect of policies considering increased contacts during the end-of-year holidays, intensification of physical distancing, and school reopening on projected confirmed cases and deaths, hospital demand, and hospital capacity exceedance in Mexico City Metropolitan Area.
