This paper presents an implementation of an effective synchronization between a registration and a stimulation module that form part of a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Each of the synchronized modules were created and designed in two different platforms as well as in two different workstations, so a particular objective of this work consisted in finding the best platforms to stimulate and register the EEG in order to create a communication channel and protocol between the two different modules. The resulting synchronization was tested with an existing SSVEP stimulation protocol in one subject. Even though the results were promising, a test on a bigger population is needed.
