`sccosmomcma` is an R package that implements the Stanford-CIDE Coronavirus Simulation Model (SC-COSMO) to evaluate the effect of policies considering increased contacts during the end-of-year holidays, intensification of physical distancing, and school reopening on projected confirmed cases and deaths, hospital demand, and hospital capacity exceedance during the covid-19 pandemic in late 2020 and early 2021 in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA).

`sccosmomcma` is part of the following manuscript:
