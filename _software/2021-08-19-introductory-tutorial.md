This GitHub repository provides the code of the tutorial on how to implement time-independent cohort state-transition models (cSTMs) in R using a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) example, explained in the following manuscript:

- Alarid-Escudero F, Krijkamp EM, Enns EA, Yang A, Hunink MGM, Pechlivanoglou P, Jalal H. An Introductory Tutorial on Cohort State-Transition Models in R Using a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Example. arXiv:200107824v3. 2021:1-26.

The release that accompanies the published article has been archived in [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/357362984).

The `R` folder includes two different scripts corresponding to functions used to synthesize cSTMs outputs and conduct several sensitivity analyses:

- `Funtions.R`: Functions to generate epidemiological measures from time-dependent cSTMs. 

- `Functions_cSTM_time_indep.R`: These functions wrap the time-independent cSTM, compute CEA measures, and generate probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) input datasets.
