excerpt: 'The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), which operates the second-largest state prison system, launched a COVID-19 vaccination program on 22 December 2020, and rapidly scaled up the program across its 35 prisons [14]. CDCR has collected detailed data relevant to COVID-19 risks, interventions, and outcomes, and has maintained an extensive, multilayered testing program since early in the pandemic when large outbreaks occurred [15, 16]. We analyzed these data to estimate effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection among nearly 61,000 incarcerated people in California.'

## Abstract
### Introduction
Prisons and jails are high-risk settings for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccines may substantially reduce these risks, but evidence is needed on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness for incarcerated people, who are confined in large, risky congregate settings.

### Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate effectiveness of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), against confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections among incarcerated people in California prisons from 22 December 2020 through 1 March 2021. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation provided daily data for all prison residents including demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics, as well as COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and outcomes. We estimated vaccine effectiveness using multivariable Cox models with time-varying covariates, adjusted for resident characteristics and infection rates across prisons.

### Results
Among 60,707 cohort members, 49% received at least 1 BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 dose during the study period. Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 74% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64%–82%) from day 14 after first dose until receipt of second dose and 97% (95% CI, 88%–99%) from day 14 after second dose. Effectiveness was similar among the subset of residents who were medically vulnerable: 74% (95% CI, 62%–82%) and 92% (95% CI, 74%–98%) from 14 days after first and second doses, respectively.

### Conclusion
Consistent with results from randomized trials and observational studies in other populations, mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among incarcerated people. Prioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination, redoubling efforts to boost vaccination, and continuing other ongoing mitigation practices are essential in preventing COVID-19 in this disproportionately affected population.
