## Abstract
### Objective
In 2007, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Mexico implemented a multidisciplinary health-care model (MHC) for patients with type-2 diabetes (T2D), which has proven more effective in controlling this condition than the conventional health-care model (CHC).

### Research design and methods
We compared the cost-effectiveness of the MHC vs. the CHC for patients with T2D using a quasi-experimental, retrospective design. Epidemiologic and cost data were obtained from a randomly selected sample of health-care units, using medical records as well as patient- and facility-level data. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of the MHC at one, 10 and 20 years using a simulation model.

### Results
The average cumulative costs per patient at 20 years were US&#36;4,225 for the MHC and US&#36;4,399 for the CHC. With a willingness to pay one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) (US&#36;8,910), the incremental net benefits per patient were US&#36;1,450 and US&#36;3,737 at 10 and 20 years, respectively. The MHC was cost-effective from the third year onward; however, increasing coverage to 500 patients per year rendered it cost-effective at year one.

### Conclusions
The MHC is cost-effective at 10 and 20 years. Cost-effectiveness can be achieved in the short term by increasing MHC coverage.
