## Abstract
### Objective 
To quantify the costs and benefits of three HIV prevention interventions in migrants in Central America: voluntary counseling and testing, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, and condom distribution.

### Materials and Methods 
The methods were: a) identification and quantification of costs; b) quantification of benefits, defined as the potential savings in antiretroviral treatment of HIV cases prevented; and c) estimation of the cost-benefit ratio.
RESULTS: The model estimated that 9, 21 and 8 cases of HIV were prevented by voluntary counseling and testing, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and condom distribution per 10 000 migrants, respectively. In Panama, condom distribution and treatment for sexually transmitted infections had a return of <span>&#36;</span>131/USD and <span>&#36;</span>69.8/USD. Returns in El Salvador were <span>&#36;</span>2.0/USD and <span>&#36;</span>42.3/USD in voluntary counseling and testing and condom distribution, respectively.

### Conclusion 
The potential savings on prevention have a large variation between countries. Nevertheless, the cost-benefit estimates suggest that the HIV prevention programs in Central America can potentially result in monetary savings in the long run.
