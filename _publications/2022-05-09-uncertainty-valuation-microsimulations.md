excerpt: 'In this article, we showed that  Extreme-scale Model Exploration with Swift (EMEWS) could facilitate the use of HPC to implement computationally demanding Bayesian calibration routines to correctly characterize the uncertainty of the calibrated parameters of microsimulation DMs and propagate it in the evaluation of CEA of screening strategies and quantify their value of information. This study’s methodology and results could guide a similar VOI analysis on CEAs using microsimulation DMs to determine where more research is needed and guide research prioritization.'

## Abstract
### Background
We evaluated the implications of different approaches to characterize the uncertainty of calibrated parameters of microsimulation decision models (DMs) and quantified the value of such uncertainty in decision making.

### Methods 
We calibrated the natural history model of CRC to simulated epidemiological data with different degrees of uncertainty and obtained the joint posterior distribution of the parameters using a Bayesian approach. We conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) on all the model parameters with different characterizations of the uncertainty of the calibrated parameters. We estimated the value of uncertainty of the various characterizations with a value of information analysis. We conducted all analyses using high-performance computing resources running the Extreme-scale Model Exploration with Swift (EMEWS) framework.

### Results
The posterior distribution had a high correlation among some parameters. The parameters of the Weibull hazard function for the age of onset of adenomas had the highest posterior correlation of −0.958. When comparing full posterior distributions and the maximum-a-posteriori estimate of the calibrated parameters, there is little difference in the spread of the distribution of the CEA outcomes with a similar expected value of perfect information (EVPI) of $653 and $685, respectively, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $66,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Ignoring correlation on the calibrated parameters’ posterior distribution produced the broadest distribution of CEA outcomes and the highest EVPI of $809 at the same WTP threshold.

### Conclusion
Different characterizations of the uncertainty of calibrated parameters affect the expected value of eliminating parametric uncertainty on the CEA. Ignoring inherent correlation among calibrated parameters on a PSA overestimates the value of uncertainty.
