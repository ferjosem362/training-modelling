His research focuses on developing statistical and decision-analytic models to identify optimal prevention, control, and treatment policies to address a wide range of public health problems regionally, nationally, and internationally, and develops novel methods to quantify the value of future research. Dr. Alarid-Escudero is part of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET), a consortium of NCI-sponsored investigators that includes modeling to improve our understanding of the impact of cancer control interventions (e.g., prevention, screening, and treatment) on population trends in incidence and mortality. Dr. Alarid-Escudero co-founded the [Stanford-CIDE Coronavirus Simulation Modeling (SC-COSMO)](https://www.sc-cosmo.org) workgroup. He also co-founded the [Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH)](http://darthworkgroup.com) workgroup and the [Collaborative Network on Value of Information (ConVOI)](https://www.convoi-group.org), international and multi-institutional collaborative efforts where we develop transparent and open-source solutions to implement decision analysis and quantify the value of potential future investigation for health policy analysis.
